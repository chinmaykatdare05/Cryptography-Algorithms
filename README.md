# Cryptography Algorithms

### 1. Caesar Cipher
The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques. It is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. The shift value is the key, and in the case of Caesar Cipher, it is usually a small integer.

### 2. Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange is a method for two parties to agree on a shared secret key over an untrusted network. It allows secure communication without the need for a pre-shared secret. The security of Diffie-Hellman is based on the difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem.

### 3. Digital Signature
A digital signature is a cryptographic technique used to verify the authenticity and integrity of a message or document. It involves creating a digital signature using a private key and then verifying it using the corresponding public key. Digital signatures are essential for ensuring the origin and integrity of electronic messages.

### 4. Playfair Cipher
The Playfair Cipher is a digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters (digraphs), rather than individual letters as in the case of simple substitution ciphers. It was designed to improve upon the security of traditional substitution ciphers by working with digraphs, making frequency analysis more challenging.

### 5. RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)
RSA is a widely used public-key cryptosystem for secure data transmission. It involves the use of a pair of keys: a public key, which is shared openly, and a private key, kept secret. The security of RSA is based on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers.

### 6. Vigenere Cipher
The Vigenere Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. Instead of using a single shift value like the Caesar Cipher, the Vigenere Cipher uses a keyword. The letters of the keyword determine the shift values for the corresponding letters in the plaintext.
